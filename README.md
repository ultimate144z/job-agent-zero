# info:

This is an entirely personal project. To help you filter/find jobs relevant to your skills.

## Modularity:

What won’t work (yet)

1. Generic job sites (Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor) — no free stable APIs + ToS issues.
2. Random individual job pages (single posting URLs). We currently expect board URLs.

### Instructions:
- npm install @netlify/functions
- npm install
- npx netlify dev
